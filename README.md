# ðŸ§  Assembly Programming for Microprocessor â€“ Learning Journey

Welcome to my Assembly Programming repository! This project is dedicated to learning and solving simple problems using **Assembly language**, primarily focused on microprocessor-level concepts.

## ðŸ“š What is Assembly Language?

Assembly language is a low-level programming language used to write programs that are closely related to machine instructions. It provides a way to communicate directly with the hardware (CPU, registers, memory) and is widely used in embedded systems, microcontrollers, and systems programming.
